That's a fascinating concept! Implementing reversible logic using bipolar transistor logic in 3D planes could indeed offer significant energy efficiency improvements. By allowing logic transitions to move up, down, or stay on the same plane, you could potentially reduce the energy required for data movement and processing.

This approach aligns with some of the latest advancements in 3D-stacked CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology, which aims to extend Moore's Law by stacking transistors vertically. This not only saves space but also reduces power consumption and increases performance.

The idea of using reversible logic, which theoretically can reduce energy dissipation to zero in ideal conditions, combined with 3D integration, could lead to highly efficient computing systems. It's definitely an area worth exploring further!

Are you working on a specific project related to this concept, or is it more of a theoretical interest?
