Let's troubleshoot why nothing is being drawn. Here are some steps to help identify the issue:

1. **Check Screen Initialization:**
   Make sure the screen is being correctly initialized and filled with the background color:

   ```python
   import pygame
   import config

   # Initialize Pygame
   pygame.init()

   # Set up the display
   screen = pygame.display.set_mode((config.SCREEN_WIDTH, config.SCREEN_HEIGHT))
   pygame.display.set_caption("3D STEAM Circuit Sculpture")

   # Fill the screen with a background color (grey for example)
   screen.fill((128, 128, 128))
   ```

2. **Update the Display:**
   Ensure you are calling `pygame.display.flip()` or `pygame.display.update()` to update the display after drawing:

   ```python
   # After drawing everything
   pygame.display.flip()  # Update the display
   ```

3. **Drawing Functions:**
   Verify that your drawing functions are being called correctly within the main loop. For example:

   ```python
   running = True
   while running:
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               running = False

       # Fill the screen with grey
       screen.fill((128, 128, 128))

       # Call your drawing functions here
       # draw_your_shapes(screen)
       # draw_reversible_logic(screen)

       pygame.display.flip()

   pygame.quit()
   ```

4. **Example Drawing Function:**
   Hereâ€™s an example of a simple drawing function that you can use to test if anything is being drawn:

   ```python
   def draw_test_shape(screen):
       pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 0, 0), (50, 50, 100, 50))  # Draw a red rectangle
       pygame.draw.circle(screen, (0, 255, 0), (200, 150), 50)  # Draw a green circle

   # Call this function within your main loop
   ```

5. **Check for Errors:**
   Look for any errors in the console that might indicate issues with the drawing functions or other parts of the code.

Try these steps and see if anything appears on the screen. If you continue to encounter issues, please share the specific part of your code where you handle drawing operations, and Iâ€™ll help you pinpoint the problem. ðŸ˜Š
